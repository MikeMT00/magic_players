# MagicPlayers

Welcome to my Magic Players CLI project! The idea of this application is for Orlando Magic basketabll fans to be able to pick one of their favorite players and get basic information on the Player they select. 


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'magic_players'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install magic_players

## Usage

Call 'bin/magic_players' in terminal. Follow prompts to select player of your choice. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
